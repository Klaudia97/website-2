    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <h3>First Cold Press</h3>
<p>Our olives are handpicked and transferred to a nearby mill where the 35°N Extra Virgin Olive Oil is extracted using a cold-press method to preserve its quality and taste.</p>

<p>The extracted oil then stays in oxygen-free containers for a while in order for it to settle naturally before bottling which reduces the need for filtering and increases the amount of preserved polyphenols.</p>

<P>Each bottle is then filled with olive oil and passes a multi-step manual quality control process before being packaged for final delivery.</p>
